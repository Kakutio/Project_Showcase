      "Bad â€“ Extremely weak, full of predictable phrases or lacking any effort.\n",

      "Engaging â€“ Holds attention and has some interesting aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captivating â€“ Well-crafted, with strong imagery and polished execution.\n",

      "Masterful â€“ Outstanding and memorable, displaying exceptional skill.\n",
